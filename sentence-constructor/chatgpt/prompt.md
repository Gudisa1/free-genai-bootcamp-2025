## Formatting Instructions

- Sentence Structures

### Clues and Considerations

### Vocabulary Table

- The vocabulary table should only include **verbs, adverbs, nouns, and adjectives** in their **dictionary form**
- Do not Provide particles in the vocabulary table, student needs to figure the correct particles to use
- The vocabulary table should only include **Japanese, Romaji, and English**.
- Do **not** use Romaji when showing Japanese text, **except in the vocabulary table**.

### Sentence Structures

- do not provide particles in the sentence structure

### Clues and Considerations

- talk about vocabulary but try to leave out the japapenese words because the student can refer to the vocabulary table.
