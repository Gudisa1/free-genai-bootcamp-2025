## Sentence Structure

**[Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?**

### Considerations:

- This is a **compound sentence** with two parts connected by a comma.
- The first part states a **location** where something exists.
- The second part is **asking about a past action**.

### Possible Next Steps:

- Attempt an answer.
- Ask for **clues** about location marking.
- Ask for **clues** about how to connect two sentences.
- Ask for **clues** about question formation.
- Ask for **clues** about verb conjugation.

### 📝 Comment:

> **Deep Seek** didn't provide particles in the vocabulary, requiring students to figure them out. However, it did include particles in the vocabulary table.  
> **Deep Seek** also provided English, Japanese, and notes in the vocabulary table, but you should **only** include Japanese, Romaji, and English.
