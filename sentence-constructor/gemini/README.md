## Which model

Gemini 2.0 Flash

<!-- I understand.  Unfortunately, Google doesn't publicly disclose the specific names or version numbers of the underlying large language models I use.  These models are constantly being developed and updated, so any specific name would likely be outdated quickly.

While I can't tell you the exact model name, I can reiterate that I am based on a large language model architecture, trained by Google.  These models are designed for a variety of language tasks, including understanding and generating text, translating languages, and answering your questions in an informative way. -->
